Python-Minecraft-Launcher
=========================

A minecraft launcher clone written in python (wxpython)

This project aims to create an open source minecraft launcher that looks/feels just like the official launcher. It will not have the same structure as the official launcher.

Update
------
Wxpython's HTMLwindow refuses to work like I want, so I will or use the beta wxpython, or I will use PySide.
Also, Mojang's making a new launcher, so I will wait 'till that's done.
